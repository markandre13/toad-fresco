 subjects. When an "edit transaction" ends
 on a given subject, the EditMgr notifies all the other
 subjects in the set allowing them to "equalize" their state
 with the modified subject.

 These operations allow adding and removing subjects as
 well as visiting and accessing subjects. 
 The nil_subject() operation returns the tag used to
 represent a nil subject. This is returned by next_subject()
 when there are no more subjects to visit and first_subject()
 when the list is empty. It can also be passed to begin_edit()
 and begin_edit_wait in order to begin a transaction.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Begin, end, or abort an edit transaction. The subject
 passed to begin_edit is considered the "current" subject
 until the end of the transaction. Only a single transaction
 can occur at any given time. The value of the nil_subject()
 operation may be passed as the subject tag. 
 
 The begin_edit operation returns false if a transaction is
 already taking place. The end_edit and abort_edit operations 
 both notify observers of the ExclusiveEditMgr, so an attached
 observer can attempt another begin_edit. (Attach the observer
 before the initial call to begin_edit in order to ensure
 the notification is not missed.)
 
 The begin_edit_wait operation blocks if a transaction
 is already taking place and returns after the transaction
 is acquired. 
 
 Whenever a Command is externally applied to the 
 current subject during a transaction, that command
 should be logged using log_command. At the transaction's end,
 the list of commands logged during the transaction are applied
 to each remaining subject. Again, the value of nil_subject()
 may be used to set the current subject when beginning a
 transaction. In this case any logged commands will be applied
 to all subjects.
