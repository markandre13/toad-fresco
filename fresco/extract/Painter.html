 to perform resolution-independent drawing.  The intent is
 to provide enough functionality to implement common
 two-dimensional text and structured graphics objects,
 but the operations should be considered neither
 complete nor particularly convenient.  Some glyphs or viewers
 will need to use more sophisticated graphics libraries,
 such as for 3D graphics or image blending.  It is important
 that a painter implementation be able to use such
 graphics libraries directly and thus allow mixing of
 painter-based objects and objects that make direct calls
 to another graphics library.
.
 A painter object represents the state necessary to perform
 drawing.  If an application wishes to have multiple threads
 drawing at the same time, then each thread should have
 a separate painter.  Unlike X, where a graphics context may be
 used in different windows, a painter is bound to one and
 only one output area (either a portion of the screen or
 a device for printing).
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Coord to_coord(in PixelCoord p, in Axis a);<BR>PixelCoord to_pixels(in Coord c, in Axis a);<BR>Coord to_pixels_coord(in Coord c, in Axis a);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations convert between pixels and coordinates
 on the painter's screen or a printer page.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void begin_path();<BR>void move_to(in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR>void line_to(in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR>void curve_to(in Coord x, in Coord y, in Coord x1, in Coord y1,in Coord x2, in Coord y2);<BR>void close_path();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations define a path for drawing as in PostScript.
 The move_to operation sets the current position of the
 path, line_to extends the path to a new position along
 a straight line, and curve_to extends the path along
 a Bezier curve.
.
 As an example of the drawing operations, the following
 code draws a filled triangle with corners (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and
 (x3,y3):
..    painter->begin_path();
..    painter->move_to(x1, y1);
..    painter->line_to(x2, y2);
..    painter->line_to(x3, y3);
..    painter->close_path();
..    painter->fill();
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> Color current_lighting;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The lighting attribute adjusts the current color to simulate
 a light source
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> Brush current_brush;<BR>attribute Color current_color;<BR>attribute Font current_font;<BR>attribute Pattern current_pattern;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These attributes are used by the drawing operations.
 It is the responsibility of objects that perform
 drawing to set these attributes explicitly, or save and
 restore them if desired.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void stroke();<BR>void fill();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The stroke operation draws the current color along
 the current path using the current brush.  The fill operation
 draws the current color inside the current path.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void line(in Coord x0, in Coord y0, in Coord x1, in Coord y1);<BR>void rect(in Coord x0, in Coord y0, in Coord x1, in Coord y1);<BR>void fill_rect(in Coord x0, in Coord y0, in Coord x1, in Coord y1);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations are short-hand for drawing common paths.
 The line and rect operations stroke a line segment and
 rectangle, respectively.  The fill_rect operation fills
 a rectangle path.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void character(in CharCode ch, in Coord width, in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR>void character_charstring(in CharString s, in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR>void character_string(in string s, in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The character operation draws the specified character from
 the current font in the current color, aligning the origin of
 the character with the given position.
 The width parameter is merely a hint as to the width of the given
 character in the current font.  A painter may use the hint
 to buffer several characters in a single drawing request,
 doing so without explicitly computing the character's width.
 The character_charstring and character_string operations are
 short-hand for repeatedly using the character operation for
 each character while each time incrementing the x coordinate
 by the character width.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void image(in Raster r, in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR>void stencil(in Raster r, in Coord x, in Coord y);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The image operation draws the given raster with its origin
 at the given position.  The stencil operation draws
 the current color through the mask defined by the raster,
 aligning its origin with the given position.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> Transform current_matrix;<BR>void push_matrix();<BR>void pop_matrix();<BR>void premultiply(in Transform t);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The current_matrix attribute defines the current transformation
 matrix applied to coordinates when drawing.  The
 push_matrix and pop_matrix operations can be used
 to save and restore the matrix.  The premultiply operation
 modifies the current matrix to contain the result of
 multiplying it by the given transformation matrix.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void clip();<BR>void clip_rect(in Coord x0, in Coord y0, in Coord x1, in Coord y1);<BR>void push_clipping();<BR>void pop_clipping();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The clip operation restricts subsequent drawing to be
 inside the current path.  The clip_rect operation restricts
 drawing within the given rectangle.  Clipping is cumulative;
 that is, two consecutive clip operations will result
 in a clipping region that is the intersection of the
 paths specified by the two requests.  The push_clipping and
 pop_clipping operations can be used to save and restore
 the current clipping region.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>boolean is_visible(in Region r);<BR>Region visible();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The is_visible operation returns true if any portion
 of the given region is within the drawing area defined
 by the clipping region.  The visible operation returns
 the current clip region.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void comment(in CharString s);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation may write an annotation in the stream of
 output commands.  As such, it has no effect on the actual
 image generated by the output commands.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void page_number(in CharString s);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation generates page number information where
 meaningful, such as when generating PostScript.
