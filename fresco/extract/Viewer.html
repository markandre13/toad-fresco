 composition of user interface objects.  Viewer is a Glyph subtype
 and can delegate the presentation and geometry of the
 viewer to another glyph using Glyph::body.
.
 A viewer implementation should define the pick operation to be
 opaque in the sense that the viewer should appear as a leaf glyph
 relative to pick calls.  This approach hides the viewer's
 structure from surrounding objects.
.
 Unlike glyphs, which may be organized with sharing to form
 a directed-acyclic graph, viewers must be organized in
 a strict hierarchy.  Using a hierarchy simplifies
 input handling and focus management.  A separate edge
 interface like GlyphOffset is therefore not necessary--
 viewers can perform the operations of both nodes and edges
 in a hierarchy.
.
 Every viewer defines a unique style with an alias identifying
 the type of viewer.  Application objects should set the name
 of a viewer's style to provide a convenient mechanism
 for customizing a particular instance.  Setting a viewer's style
 using the Glyph::style attribute will actually set the
 parent style.  By default, the parent style is the style
 of the viewer's parent.  Furthermore, because of the one-to-one
 relationship between a viewer and its style, an implementation
 may choose to represent the viewer and style as a single object
 that supports both interfaces (where retrieving viewer->style()
 simply returns the viewer itself).
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Viewer parent_viewer();<BR>Viewer next_viewer();<BR>Viewer prev_viewer();<BR>Viewer first_viewer();<BR>Viewer last_viewer();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations provide hierarchy information
 starting from a viewer, returning the parent,
 right sibling, left sibling, first child, and last child,
 respectively.  If the requested viewer does not exist,
 such as the right sibling for the last viewer
 in a list, then the operation returns a nil reference.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void append_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR>void prepend_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations modify the viewer hierarchy
 adding a child at the beginning or end of this viewer's
 list of children.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void insert_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR>void replace_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations modify the viewer hierarchy
 by adding or replacing a new viewer at the position
 of this viewer.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void remove_viewer();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Remove this viewer from its place in the hierarchy.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void set_viewer_links(in Viewer parent, in Viewer prev, in Viewer next);<BR>void set_first_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR>void set_last_viewer(in Viewer v);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations explicitly modify the links between viewers.
 They need not be called directly, but are used to maintain
 the viewer tree.
.
 The set_viewer_links operation modifies the parent, next, and
 previous links associated with a viewer.  If the parent
 is a nil reference, then a nil sibling reference will be
 ignored.  Otherwise, the parent and siblings will all be set.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Focus request_focus(in Viewer requestor, in boolean temporary);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Ask for input focus.  Normally, a viewer will call this
 operation on its parent.  The parent, in turn, may propagate
 the call to its parent.  The original caller passes
 itself as the requestor, and the same requesting viewer
 is passed if the call is propagated.
.
 If focus is granted to the requestor, the operation
 returns the focus object (normally associated with
 the root viewer of the hierarchy.  If focus is not granted,
 then the operation returns nil.
.
 Transient dialogs normally request focus temporarily
 by passing true as the second parameter to request_focus.
 This flag lets the current focus viewer know that it will
 probably regain focus shortly and might not wish to change
 its decoration in the same manner as a normal focus change.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>boolean receive_focus(in Focus f, in boolean primary);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Notify a viewer that it has acquired input focus.
 The operation returns whether the viewer accepts
 the input focus.  If the viewer does accept, then
 it should perform the appropriate operations
 on the focus object, such as installing key translations.
 If the primary parameter is true, then this viewer
 is the lowest level viewer receiving focus.  If primary
 is false, then this viewer contains a descendant
 that is the new focus.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void lose_focus(in Focus f, in boolean primary, in boolean temporary);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Notify a viewer that it is losing input focus.  The focus
 and primary values are the same values that were previously
 passed to receive focus.  If the temporary parameter is true,
 then the viewer will regain shortly, as soon as a transient such
 as a dialog finishes.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>boolean first_focus();<BR>boolean last_focus();<BR>boolean next_focus();<BR>boolean prev_focus();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations ask that this viewer "move" the input
 focus inside itself, such as tabbing through the children
 in the hierarchy.  The first_focus and last_focus
 operations ask focus to enter the viewer at the beginning
 or end, respectively.  The next_focus and prev_focus
 operations ask to move focus to the right or left sibling,
 respectively.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>boolean handle(in GlyphTraversal t, in Event e);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Respond to the given input event.  If the viewer cannot
 handle the event for any reason, then this operation
 should return false so that the caller may attempt
 to find another viewer to handle the event.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void close();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Respond to the user closing the viewer.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> Telltale state;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The viewer's state may affect the appearance of the viewer.
 If the viewer's enabled flag is on, then the viewer
 will change the state in response to input events.
