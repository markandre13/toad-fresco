 that have a geometry and may be drawn.  The name "glyph"
 is borrowed from typography to connote simple, lightweight objects 
 with an instance-specific appearance.  Glyphs also have a size
 and origin for the purposes of layout.  The Glyph interface provides
 operations for geometry management, drawing, picking, and
 a directed-acyclic structure (not strictly hierarchical).
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>struct Requirement {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean defined;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coord natural, maximum, minimum;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alignment align;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>};<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 If the defined flag is true, a requirement specifies
 a natural size, maximum size, minimum size, and
 alignment.  A composite may "stretch" a requirement
 from its natural size to its maximum size or "shrink"
 the requirement from the natural to minimum size.
 It is possible to have negative sizes, such as for
 "backwards" space.  The alignment is a fraction that
 indicates the origin of the area.  An alignment of zero
 means the origin is at the lower coordinate value;
 an alignment of one means it is at the upper coordinate value.
 Alignments can be negative or larger than one to indicate
 the origin is outside the natural position.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>struct Requisition {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirement x, y, z;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean preserve_aspect;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>};<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 A requisition contains a requirement for each axis and
 a flag indicating whether the natural aspect ratios
 should be preserved if the glyph is stretched or shrunk.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>struct AllocationInfo {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Region clipping;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Region allocation;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transform transformation;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage damaged;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>};<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The AllocationInfo structure contains specific
 cumulative geometry information.  This information
 is used to determine what regions to damage
 in order to redraw a glyph.
 Note that clipping uses window relative coordinates
 while allocation uses glyph relative coordinates.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>typedef sequence<AllocationInfo> AllocationInfoSeq;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 AllocationInfoSeq is a list of AllocationInfo
 structures to handle the possibility that a glyph
 appears several places at once on the screen.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>typedef sequence<GlyphOffset> OffsetSeq;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 OffsetSeq is a list of glyph offsets.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>struct DamageInfo {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage damaged;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>};<BR></FONT></B>

<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>typedef sequence<DamageInfo> DamageInfoSeq;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 DamageSeq is a list of Damage objects.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Glyph clone_glyph();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Return a logical copy of this glyph.  Style information
 for the target glyph is also copied, but inherited styles
 are not copied.  The target data may be locked while
 the copy is in progress.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> StyleContext style;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 A glyph may use the style attribute to customize
 the font, colors, and other characteristics
 of the glyph's appearance.  Usage of the style attribute
 is optional--a glyph may choose to ignore setting
 of the style and may return nil when the style
 is retrieved.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Transform transformation();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Return a transformation matrix associated with the glyph.
 If a glyph implementation does not provide a transform,
 this operation will return nil.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void request(out Requisition r);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation asks for a glyph's desired geometry.
 The computation should be fast to allow a composite glyph
 to compute rather than store its components' requisitions.
 In general, if a requisition might be expensive to compute
 then a glyph should store its own requisition.  A composite glyph
 therefore generally should store its requisition rather
 than traverse its components.  A composite can assume
 that GlyphOffset::notify will be called if the requisition
 of one of its children changes.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void extension(in AllocationInfo a, in Region r);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation extends the given region by the
 bounds of where this glyph would draw when given
 the allocation and transform defined by the AllocationInfo.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void shape(in Region r);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation extends the given region by the
 precise shape where this glyph would naturally draw.
 Calling shape may be more costly than calling extension
 (which just computes bounds) and therefore should only
 be called by composites that wish to perform layout
 using the actual area where the object would draw.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void traverse(in GlyphTraversal t);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Start traversing a glyph and its components.  The traversal
 object defines the operation on each glyph.  Normally,
 a composite will call traverse recursively on each
 of its components.
.
 N.B.: Because traversal state must be held by the caller
 past a call to traverse, an extra reference to the
 traversal parameter object is \emphasis{not} passed
 to the traverse operation.  Therefore, contrary to
 normal conventions, an implementation of the traverse operation
 should \emphasis{not} unref the parameter.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void draw(in GlyphTraversal t);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Display this glyph using the painter and allocation
 specified by the given traversal.  No clipping or translation
 is automatic for this operation--the allocation specifies
 the position and size of this glyph for the purposes
 of layout.  However, a composite glyph may set clipping
 or transformations on the traversal's painter before
 the composite draws its children.
.
 There is no guarantee that a call to draw will affect
 the screen immediately because of the possibility
 (indeed, likelihood) that the window is double-buffered.
 Furthermore, drawing order is important for glyphs when
 they overlap in the same plane.  A glyph's draw operation
 therefore should not be called directly, but implicitly
 will be called as part of the screen update process.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void pick(in GlyphTraversal t);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Find the glyphs that intersect a point or rectangle
 specified in window-relative coordinates.  Conceptually,
 picking is like drawing and determining what glyphs
 intersect the point or region.  When pick returns,
 the traversal contains a list of the glyph trails
 that were hit.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#808080">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica> Glyph body;<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 The body attribute defines a glyph as the recipient
 of operations.  Glyphs that have a body defined
 are typically "filters" that decorate, align, or
 otherwise adjust the appearance of the body.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void append(in Glyph g);<BR>void prepend(in Glyph g);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Add the given glyph to this composite.  If the receiver
 is not actually a composite, the operation will be ignored.
 If the receiver has a body glyph, it should pass the operation
 on to the body.  In this way, "wrapper" glyphs can
 alter appearance without affecting structural operations.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>Tag add_parent(in GlyphOffset parent_offset);<BR>void remove_parent(in Tag add_tag);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Add or remove a parent for this glyph.  Because
 a glyph could possibly be added more than once as a child
 of the same parent, an offset represents
 the parent edge.  The add_parent operation returns
 a tag that the offset retains to remove itself
 from the child's parent list when the edge is removed.
 The child should not hold a reference to its parent
 (otherwise it would create a cycle), so the parent_offset
 is not passed with a reference and should not be unref'd
 by the add_parent operation.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>GlyphOffset first_child_offset();<BR>GlyphOffset last_child_offset();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Return the offset of the first or last of this glyph's
 list of children.  Both operations will return nil
 if the glyph has no children.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void parent_offsets(inout OffsetSeq parents);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Get the offsets of the parents of this glyph.
 The parameter is inout to allow the caller to allocate
 a fixed size array for the result.  If this glyph
 has more parents than the maximum size given for the list,
 then it will allocate new storage for the list.
 The caller therefore must check to see whether the
 resulting size is smaller or now to deallocate
 the list elements correctly.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void allocations(inout AllocationInfoSeq a);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Compute cumulative information for each allocation
 of the glyph.  This operation normally need not
 be called directly; instead application objects
 usually call need_redraw or need_resize.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void damages(inout DamageInfoSeq d);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 Compute the list of Damage objects that a glyph is
 involved with.  This list is useful for batching
 updates by calling begin_update and end_update on
 the Damage objects.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void need_redraw();<BR>void need_redraw_region(in Region r);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 These operations request that a glyph cause its appearance
 on the screen to be refreshed. If the glyph appears
 in multiple places in a window or in several windows,
 the glyph should be redrawn in all the places.
 A glyph may choose not to implement these operations
 Under the assumption that update is either not possible
 or will be handled by higher-level glyphs.
.
 The need_redraw operation asks that the entire glyph
 be redrawn; need_redraw_region specifies an area
 relative to the glyph's coordinate space. One use of
 need_redraw_region is to redraw the region surrounding the 
 merged before and after areas of a transformed glyph.
 
 Note these operations do not actually cause an immediate
 screen update; they merely notify the system that
 a draw traversal is desired in the near future.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>void need_resize();<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation is similar to need_redraw, but
 includes the additional possibility that the glyph's
 natural size has changed.  This operation implies
 two redraw requests (which will be handled with
 a single draw traversal), one for the glyph's original area
 and one for the glyph's new area.
<TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FF8000">
<B><FONT FACE=helvetica>boolean restore_trail(in GlyphTraversal t);<BR></FONT></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
 This operation attempts to restore the traversal state
 (allocation and drawing state) for the given traversal
 The return value indicates whether restoration is successful.
